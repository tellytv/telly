# telly

IPTV proxy for Plex Live written in Golang

Please refer to the [Wiki](https://github.com/tellytv/telly/wiki) for the most current documentation.

## This readme refers to version 1.1.x .  It does not apply to versions other than that.

The [Wiki](https://github.com/tellytv/telly/wiki) includes walkthroughs for most platforms that go into more detail than listed below:

## THIS IS A DEVELOPMENT BRANCH

It is under active development and things may change quickly and dramatically.  Please join the discord server if you use this branch and be prepared for some tinkering and breakage.

# Configuration

Here's an example configuration file. **You will need to create this file.**  It should be placed in `/etc/telly/telly.config.toml` or `$HOME/.telly/telly.config.toml` or `telly.config.toml` in the directory that telly is running from.

> NOTE "the directory telly is running from" is your CURRENT WORKING DIRECTORY.  For example, if telly and its config file file are in `/opt/telly/` and you run telly from your home directory, telly will not find its config file because it will be looking for it in your home directory.  If this makes little sense to you, use one of the other two locations OR cd into the directory where telly is located before running it from the command line.

> ATTENTION Windows users: be sure that there isnâ€™t a hidden extension on the file.  Telly can't read its config file if it's named something like `telly.config.toml.txt`.

# FFMpeg

Telly can buffer the streams to Plex through ffmpeg.  This has the potential for several benefits, but today it primarily:

1. Allows support for stream formats that may cause problems for Plex directly.
1. Eliminates the use of redirects and makes it possible for telly to report exactly why a given stream failed.

To take advantage of this, ffmpeg must be installed and available in your path.

# Docker

There are two different docker images available:

## tellytv/telly:dev
The standard docker image for the dev branch

## tellytv/telly:dev-ffmpeg
This docker image has ffmpeg preinstalled.  If you want to use the ffmpeg feature, use this image.  It may be safest to use this image generally, since it is not much larger than the standard image and allows you to turn the ffmpeg features on and off without requiring changes to your docker run command.  The examples below use this image.

## `docker run`
```
docker run -d \
  --name='telly' \
  --net='bridge' \
  -e TZ="America/Chicago" \
  -p '6077:6077/tcp' \
  -v /host/path/to/telly.config.toml:/etc/telly/telly.config.toml \
  --restart unless-stopped \
  tellytv/telly:dev-ffmpeg
```

## docker-compose
```
telly:
  image: tellytv/telly:dev-ffmpeg
  ports:
    - "6077:6077"
  environment:
    - TZ=Europe/Amsterdam
  volumes:
    - /host/path/to/telly.config.toml:/etc/telly/telly.config.toml
  restart: unless-stopped
```
